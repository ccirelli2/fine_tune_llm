       Dear William Shea:

       Form 10-K for Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2023

       Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
       Fiscal 2023 Results, page 22

   1.                                                   You present and discuss
non-GAAP measures in various places without presenting and
                                                        discussing the
comparable GAAP measures for the same periods with equal or greater
                                                        prominence. For
example, adjusted EBITDA is presented and discussed in two places on
                                                        page 22 of your Form
10-K without presenting and discussing net income (loss) for the
                                                        same periods. In
addition, the headline earnings section of your Item 2.02 Form 8-K filed
                                                        August 31, 2023
presents adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted
                                                        EBITDA and free cash
flow without presenting net income (loss) or net cash provided by
                                                        operating activities
for the same periods. Free cash flow is then presented again in the
                                                        Fiscal Year 2023
Highlights without net cash provided by operating activities being
                                                        presented. Also, no
reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free
                                                        cash flow is included
in the Form 8-K. Please revise your disclosures accordingly. Refer
                                                        to Question 102.10(a)
of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures Compliance and Disclosure
                                                        Interpretations and
Item 10(e)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K. In your Annual Report to
 William Shea
1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.

Page 2
         Shareholders, please also present net cash provided by operating
activities, since free cash
         flow is presented in the letter to shareholders, and reconcile from
net cash provided by
         operating activities to free cash flow. Refer to Rule 100(a) of
Regulation G.
2.       You present and discuss several pro forma measures throughout your
filing, which do not
         appear to be pro forma measures, as contemplated in Article 11 of
Regulation S-X. Please
         retitle these measures to better reflect what they actually represent
and do not refer to
         them as being pro forma measures. If any of these measures are
non-GAAP measures,
         also provide the disclosures required by Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.
Refer to Question
         100.05 of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures Compliance and Disclosure
